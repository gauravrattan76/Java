The name of the class has to be same of the file name, one class has to be public

Class names start with uppercase

method names in small case


In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.

Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).

The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:

File Name - Main.java

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:

The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about how System, out and println() works. Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).

Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".


There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

   System.out.println("Hello world");
    System.out.print("gaurav");
     System.out.print("gaurav1");
